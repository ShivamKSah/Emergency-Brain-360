- **Triage Summaries**: Concise clinical summaries for quick decision-making

### Data Visualization
- **Severity Distribution Chart**: Visual representation of patient urgency levels
- **Vital Signs Charts**: Graphical displays of patient vital statistics
- **Symptom Analysis**: Breakdown of presenting symptoms across the patient population
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live updates of emergency department metrics

### Technical Features
- **Local Storage**: Client-side data persistence using browser localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface optimized for various screen sizes
- **Interactive UI**: Modern React-based interface with smooth animations and transitions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm package manager
- Google Gemini API key (for AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd emergency-brain-360
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a [.env.local](.env.local) file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Builds the production-ready application
- `npm run preview` - Previews the built application locally

## üìä Application Architecture

### Core Components
- **App.tsx**: Main application component managing state and routing
- **Header.tsx**: Navigation header with view switching controls
- **PatientList.tsx**: Displays active patients with triage priority indicators
- **PatientDetail.tsx**: Detailed view of individual patient information
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Overview panel with statistical charts and metrics
- **NewPatientForm.tsx**: Intake form for adding new patients to the system
- **ArchiveView.tsx**: Historical view of all patient records
- **DischargedView.tsx**: Records of discharged patients

### Services Layer
- **geminiService.ts**: Integration with Google Gemini AI for intelligent analysis
- **patientDBService.ts**: Client-side database management using localStorage
- **triageService.ts**: Business logic for calculating triage scores and classifications

### Data Models
- **types.ts**: TypeScript interfaces defining patient data structures
- **patientData.ts**: Seed data for initial patient records

### UI Components
- **Charts**: Recharts-based visualizations for data representation
- **SparklesWelcomePage.tsx**: Animated welcome screen with particle effects
- **Custom UI Elements**: Specialized components for medical data presentation

## ü§ñ AI Integration

The application integrates with Google's Gemini AI to enhance clinical decision-making:

### AI Capabilities
1. **Vital Signs Analysis**: Compares patient vitals to normal ranges and highlights abnormalities
2. **Triage Scoring Explanation**: Provides reasoning behind the calculated urgency scores
3. **Treatment Recommendations**: Generates personalized care suggestions based on patient data
4. **Clinical Summaries**: Creates concise summaries for dashboard display

### Fallback Behavior
When the GEMINI_API_KEY is not configured, the application gracefully degrades to rule-based triage scoring while maintaining full functionality of non-AI features. Clear notifications inform users when AI features are unavailable.

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.2
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Particle Effects**: tsparticles
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI SDK
- **Persistence**: Browser localStorage

## üìà Triage Scoring System

The application employs a weighted scoring system to determine patient urgency:

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Chest pain | +4 |
| Shortness of breath | +4 |
| Temperature > 101¬∞F | +2 |
| Oxygen saturation < 90% | +3 |
| Heart rate > 120 bpm | +2 |
| Respiratory rate > 24/min | +2 |
| Unconsciousness | +5 |
| Semi-consciousness | +3 |
| Age > 65 years | +2 |
| Presence of comorbidities | +2 |

### Urgency Classification
- **Red (8+ points)**: Immediate attention required
- **Yellow (4-7 points)**: Prompt evaluation needed
- **Green (0-3 points)**: Routine care appropriate

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Privacy & Security

- All patient data is stored locally in the browser
- No patient information is transmitted to external servers (except for AI analysis)
- Healthcare professionals are responsible for securing devices used to access the application
- PHI compliance is maintained through local storage and lack of external data transmission
